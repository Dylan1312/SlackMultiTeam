# SlackMultiTeam
Allows Slack communication across different teams, effectively creating 'shared channels'

Grab an API key from each 'Slack Team', and the channels you want to 'clone' (get ids here -> https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list/test). Throw these into config.py.

Make sure you have the requests module and then run run.py
